Make list funcs use refs, deal with it in consuming code

ensure const is used wherever possible

ensure objects are passed by const reference whenever possible

ensure all classes with dyn mem (Animal&subs, lists, nodes) can deep copy (or delete copy constr)

ensure all =operators return a reference to their object (*this)

ensure order of declarations is as follows:
	preprocessor directives
	includes
	header comment
	constructors
	destructor
	methods
	data (private or protected)
