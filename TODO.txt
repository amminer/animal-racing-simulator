RETROSPECTIVE:

Should have derived an animalList from each LLL and CLL, reduce coupling dramatically between Animal and other classes

Should have been better about documenting as I went, but design was somewhat in flux until the end of the project - forcing the data structures as necessary design elements made this very hard.

Should have written an Animal::display_flat(void) instead of hard-coding flat output in some parts of Stadium.cpp
