Ensure const is used wherever possible

Ensure objects are passed by const reference whenever possible

Ensure all classes with dyn mem (Animal&subs, lists, nodes) can deep copy (or delete copy constr)

Ensure all =operators return a reference to their object (*this)

Ensure order of declarations is as follows:
	preprocessor directives
	includes
	header comment
	constructors
	destructor
	methods
	data (private or protected)

RETROSPECTIVE:

Should have derived an animalList from each LLL and CLL, reduce coupling dramatically between Animal and other classes
Should have been better about documenting as I went, but design was somewhat in flux until the end of the project - forcing the data structures as necessary design elements made this very hard.
