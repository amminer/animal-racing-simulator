 * FILE: Stable.h
 * PURPOSE: Main purpose is to contain an array of linkedlists, which will store animals
 * 	whose object lifetimes will be from when they are created until they are manually deleted
 * 	by the user or until the program quits and the Stable object is destroyed.
 *		May also implement functionality between this class and Animal to breed new animals with
 *	stats based on their parents.
